# MaxiJP (MaxJDK)
## _known to hackers as jacks4_

Hiya! My name is Max and I am a Java/Python developer for the UK. Yet to be hired, but sure as hell hope to solve someones problems with Spigot or Java! (I think we know thats not going to happen though lol.)

## What I'm working on
- Max Unix (Manix) - A UNIX-like hobby operating system that I have wanted to make for a while. Tried it once, got a smiley face and some ASCII text to display to the screen magically with some BIOS interrupts but that was about it. (https://github.com/maxijp/manix-attempt). I'm going to try again with the Christmas break at my school as an excuse to get it done. Check it out: https://github.com/maxijp/maxunix

## What I'm working on
- Malux - A linux distro with full support for everything that I need like Kubernetes, Docker, Java 8, and other fun shit.
- MaxPvP-Essentials (Spigot/Paper); not really working on this one right now, but will probably upload the source code if you really want to see the shitty hell-hole it really is (I've warned you, and yes everything is in the main class...)
